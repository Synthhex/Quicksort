# DISCLAIMER
The random-pivot quicksort does not function correctly. Try the others. The two other possible methods are "first_quicksort()" and "last_quicksort()"

An example program entry has been written for you. Note that the Stopwatch class' precision is sometimes not enough and will usually print out zero milliseconds for smaller arrays.
